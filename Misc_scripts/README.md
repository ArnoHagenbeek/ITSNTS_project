# Miscellaneous scripts for data wrangling and file handling
## Info
This folder contains loose python scripts for general file handling and data wrangling. Due to their self-contained and small-scale nature, no README will be given per script. Their commandline use is described within the scripts themselves, at the top of the script. 

## Content
