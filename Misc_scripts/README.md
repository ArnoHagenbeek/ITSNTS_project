# Miscellaneous scripts for data wrangling and file handling
## Info
This folder contains loose python scripts for general file handling and data wrangling. Due to their self-contained and small-scale nature, no README will be given per script. Their commandline use is described within the scripts themselves, at the top of the script. 

## Content
- **Benchmark_data_generate.py:** Script for generating metagenome data of known compositions.
- **Bin_tsv_to_fasta.py:** Script for reconstructing bin fastas from binning tsv files.
- **EggNOG_COG_counter.py:** Script for counting COG terms from EggNOG outputs.
- **EggNOG_to_KEGG.py:** Script for generating a tsv file parsable by KEGG reconstruct from EggNOG.
- **Fasta_renamer.py:** Script for renaming (NCBI) fasta files to reflect their sequence names.
- **Fasta_splitter.py:** Script for splitting a multifasta sequence into multiple fasta files.
- **Symcla_faa_prep.py:** Script for reformatting .faa files to match symcla requirements
