# General purpose binning and bin refinement pipeline

This pipeline will bin the provided metagenome assemblies using Metabat2, CONCOCT, Semibin, and Rosella, and subsequently perform bin refinement using DASTool. 

Note: These script in this pipeline were designed to run directly on DEIGO, the OIST scientific computer cluster. Due to its reliance on modules, it will likely require significant rewriting to function on other machines.
